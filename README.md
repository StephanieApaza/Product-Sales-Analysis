# Sales Methods Analysis 📊
## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the effectiveness of different sales methods for a new product line.
The main objective is to identify which method maximizes revenue generation while optimizing time and resources.

## 🎯 Business Questions
The analysis answers the following questions:
1. How many customers were reached with each sales method?
2. What is the revenue distribution overall and by method?
3. Did revenue change over time depending on the method?
4. Which sales method should be prioritized?
5. Are there significant differences between customer groups?

## 📐 Business Metric
To evaluate efficiency, I created a custom metric:

**💡 Revenue per Minute of Effort**:
This allows us to compare fairly across methods, balancing revenue with the time invested.

## ✅ Key Results
- 📞 Calls → $1.59 per minute
- 📧 Emails + Calls → $18.38 per minute
- ✉️ Emails → $19.40 per minute

➡️ Emails showed the highest efficiency, though assumptions on preparation time highlight the need for further data collection.

## 🧭 Recommendations
- Prioritize Email as the main sales method.
- Use Calls strategically with high-value customers.
