# Sales Methods Analysis 📊
## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the effectiveness of different sales methods for a new product line.
The main objective is to identify which method maximizes revenue generation while optimizing time and resources.

## 🎯 Business Questions
The analysis answers the following questions:
1. How many customers were reached with each sales method?
2. What is the revenue distribution overall and by method?
3. Did revenue change over time depending on the method?
4. Which sales method should be prioritized?
5. Are there significant differences between customer groups?

## 📐 Business Metric
To evaluate efficiency, I created a custom metric:

**💡 Revenue per Minute of Effort**:
This allows us to compare fairly across methods, balancing revenue with the time invested.

## ✅ Key Results
- 📞 Calls → $1.59 per minute
- 📧 Emails and Calls → $18.38 per minute
- ✉️ Emails → $19.40 per minute

➡️ Emails and Calls as the primary sales method, this method shows a strong positive impact on revenue, a clear growth trend over time, and balances efficiency.

## 🧭 Recommendations
- Monitor efficiency using revenue per minute of effort. This metric highlights that Email and Call delivers high returns relative to the time invested.
- Leverage the Email method as a complementary strategy. While slightly less efficient than Email and Call, Email alone reaches the largest number of customers, generates the most site visits, and leads to the highest number of products sold.
